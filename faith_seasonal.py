        Quick note about Discord user mentions before you read this function:
        Discord users all have a unique ID that can be used to mention them as if you were to @ their name.
        I'll call this the user mention. It looks something like this: <@162606971705491458> or <@!179067358369939456>
        Your user mention may or may not have an '!' as it's third character. This is dynamic as far as I know.
        Because of this, user-rsn pairs are saved by the bot based on your ID number, not the extraneous symbols.
        When creating SENDER_LIST, the bot looks up users based on their mention. There is a check in there that removes the
        extra '!' if the user does not have one in their mention
